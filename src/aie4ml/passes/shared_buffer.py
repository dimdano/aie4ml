"""How a direct edge is realised, and whether it can be one shared buffer where it must be.

A direct stream edge moves data on core streams. A direct buffer edge joins two buffer ports, and every
op pins the buffers of its buffer ports where its locations say, one copy per bank, so the AIE compiler
realises it as one buffer both kernels reach exactly where the producer's and the consumer's locations
coincide, and as a DMA copy between two pinned buffers anywhere else. An edge the execution graph marks
`shared_memory` must be the former, which is known before the compiler runs:

- each port is a buffer port bound to exactly one kernel port, and the value has no other reader, so
  nothing asks for a copy (fanout, multicast, a graph output, a view);
- once both ops are placed, the two ports' locations coincide.

The first does not depend on placement, and the placer refuses it outright; it asks the second while it
searches. The physical verifier asks both again of the finished plan.
