"""A compile-free estimate of a kernel's cycles per call: per code group and cascade role, a linear fit over every
product of a subset of the kernel's shape features, on compiled kernels' static issue cycles, plus the group's
stall share from simulated single kernels and its wrapper cycles. Each estimate carries the empirical range of
held-out calibration kernels -- evidence, not a bound -- and anything outside the calibrated region, range, groups,
target or sources is refused with its reason.

A kernel's cost reads only its own features and role; its chains' length and number are the graph's. For chains,
`cascade_timeline` spreads the cycles over blocks of partial results, words read before each block and written
after. The artifact also holds the target's fitted cascade link latency and handoff setups (aie4ml.cost.design).
