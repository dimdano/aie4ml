"""How calibration treats each op type, kept out of the variants: optional, one entry per op type.

A kernel's complete `kernel_params` are its truth. `features` names the workload fields its cost grows with; every
other field sets its code group, but those `not_code` names with evidence that the kernel's code does not read them.
A field wrongly named there shows only if calibration samples two of its values at one coordinate. `space` is how
calibration (aie4ml.cost.calibrate) exercises the op type: discrete choices, candidate shapes, a model builder
selecting a given variant, and multi-layer models for transport; lowering decides what is legal.
